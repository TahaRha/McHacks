# McHacks

Unfortunately, we ran with some problems while trying to parse the twitter feed. Thus, we can't use the profile pictures on a user's timeline yet. We are still working on it, but it can't be done by the end of the hackathon. However, our image recognition software is usable and ready. Even though the product is not finished, we still wanted to show you guys what we have been working on for the past 36hrs, as we are very passionate about it.
